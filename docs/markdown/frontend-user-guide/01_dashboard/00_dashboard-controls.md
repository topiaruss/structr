The Dashboard controls allow you to modify visualization parameters of the layout engine.

<table>
<tr><td>Max. depth*</td><td>Limits the number of nodes that are displayed to increase readability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Max Rels*</td><td>Limits the number of relationships that are displayed to increase readability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nodes</td><td>Displays the number of nodes that are in the current rendering set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rels</td><td>Displays the number of relationships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enable Relationships</td><td>Toggles the visibility and force of all relationships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Relationship Length</td><td>Controls the length of the relationship lines. The larger this value is, the more force will be exerted on the relationship nodes, i.e. the farther they will be pushed apart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Center Force</td><td>Controls the force that pulls nodes of a certain type to their center of gravity. The larger this value is, the closer will nodes of the same type be grouped together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repellant Force</td><td>Controls the force that pushed nodes apart. The larger this value is, the more force will be exerted on every single node, trying to move away from other nodes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Drag</td><td>Controls the force that opposes the movement of nodes, i.e. the resistance against movement. The larger this value is, the slower will nodes move.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Node Types</td><td>The node types list will contain a checkbox for each distinct node type that is visible in the current rendering set. By checking or unchecking the boxes, you can control which of the types are visible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Relationship Types</td><td>The relationship types list will contain a checkbox for each distinct relationship type that is visible in the current rendering set. You can enable or disable the visibility and force of each relationship type by checking or unchecking the boxes.</td></tr>
